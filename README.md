## Password-Cracker-
This project compares different ways of storing and cracking passwords. Specifically, it compares the following:

* Storing passwords in plain text format
* Storing hashed passwords using the SHA-256 algorithm
* Cracking passwords using a brute-force dictionary attack

In addition, a simple web page is included to demonstrate how the password cracker function works.The page provides an input field for a password, and upon submission, it calls the passwordCracker function and displays the cracked password and the time it took to crack it.
